\#\# Layout Structure

\#\#\# Desktop Experience  
\- \*\*Header\*\*: Fixed-position minimal header with logo/name on left and navigation elements on right  
\- \*\*Main Grid System\*\*: Asymmetrical grid layout using 12-column structure with varying column spans to create visual interest  
\- \*\*Hero Section\*\*: Full-width introduction with text positioned using golden ratio principles  
\- \*\*Case Study Grid\*\*: Masonry-style grid layout with varied card heights and widths  
\- \*\*About Section\*\*: Split-screen layout with personal information and professional experience  
\- \*\*Contact Area\*\*: Full-width dedicated section with simple form and contact information  
\- \*\*Footer\*\*: Minimal footer with essential links and copyright information

\#\#\# Content Containers  
\- Project cards use overlapping elements to create depth  
\- Content sections use strategic asymmetry with 60/40 or 70/30 splits  
\- White space used deliberately as a layout element, not just as padding  
\- Visual hierarchy reinforced through positioning and scale rather than heavy use of color

\#\# Core Components

\#\#\# Navigation  
\- \*\*Desktop\*\*: Horizontal navigation bar that transforms into a condensed "sticky" version when scrolling  
\- \*\*Mobile\*\*: Hamburger menu that expands to full-screen overlay with large touch targets  
\- \*\*States\*\*: Clear visual indicators for current page and hover/focus states  
\- \*\*Behavior\*\*: Smooth scrolling to page sections when navigation items are activated

\#\#\# Case Study Cards  
\- \*\*Structure\*\*: Cards with layered information revealing progressively on interaction  
\- \*\*Composition\*\*: Featured image, project title, brief description, and tags/categories  
\- \*\*States\*\*: Rest, hover, focus, and active states with meaningful transitions  
\- \*\*Interactions\*\*: Subtle scale increase and information reveal on hover/focus
